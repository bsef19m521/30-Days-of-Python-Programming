## Day 22: Stack Data Structure and Its Operations 



**Learning Agenda:**
- Introduction to stack data structure and its operations
- What is a stack and its characteristics
- Stack declaration and initialization
- Stack operations (push, pop, peek, is_empty)
- Implementing stack using an array and linked list
- Stack traversal and iteration
- Understanding stack overflow and underflow
- Time and space complexity of common stack operations
- Using stacks in combination with other data structures (e.g. queues, linked lists, trees)
- Applications of stack in real-world problem solving (e.g. expression evaluation, backtracking, recursion)
- Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of using a stack
- Implementing stack in Python
- Using a stack to implement other data structures (e.g. Infix to postfix conversion)
- Some basic examples of how to use these concepts in practice.
