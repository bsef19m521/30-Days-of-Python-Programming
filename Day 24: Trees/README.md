##   Day 24: Trees 
    
> **Binary Tress, BST, AVL Tress, Operations: Insert, Delete, Search, Traversal**



**Learning Agenda:**
- Introduction to tree data structures and their operations
- Types of Trees: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees
- Tree declaration and initialization
- Inserting and deleting elements in a tree
- Tree traversal (pre-order, in-order, post-order, level-order)
- Searching for elements in a tree
- Understanding the properties of balanced and unbalanced trees
- Implementing tree operations in Python
- Time and space complexity of common tree operations
- Using trees in combination with other data structures (e.g. hash tables, graphs)
- Applications of trees in real-world problem solving (e.g. file systems, decision making)
- Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of using different types of trees (BST, AVL, etc.)
- The difference between a binary tree and a binary search tree
- Some basic examples of how to use these concepts in practice.
