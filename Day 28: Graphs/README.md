##   Day 28: Graphs 

> **Graph representation, Graph traversal, Shortest path algorithms**


**Learning Agenda:**

- Introduction to graph data structures and their operations
- Types of Graphs: Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted
- Graph representation (adjacency list, adjacency matrix, edge list)
- Graph traversal (depth-first search, breadth-first search)
- Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, A*)
- Implementing graph algorithms in Python
- Time and space complexity of common graph algorithms
- Using graphs in combination with other data structures (e.g. trees, heaps)
- Applications of graph algorithms in real-world problem solving (e.g. routing, network flow)
- Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of using different graph algorithms
- Understanding the properties of connected and disconnected graphs
- The difference between directed and undirected graph
- Understanding the concept of weighted and unweighted graph
- Some basic examples of how to use these concepts in practice.
